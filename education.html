        <p>I have furthered my studies of the subject of computer science at the University of Florida's College of Liberal Arts. 
            Currently, I'm learning about the interworkings of Python and C++ in my Advanced Computing Fundamentals class. This school's 
            computer science program is bound to prepare me for the real world, with classes spanning from Data Structures and Algorithmns, 
            Discrete Math, and a required Senior Project.

        <h4>Description: </h4>
        <p>
            I was one of the few selected from my town to attend this prestigious county magnet school. 
            I selected AIT to focus my studies on programming, as well as learn how they're applied in the real world 
            through business and IT companies. The environment that this academy put me in was very diverse, as the top students 
            from across the county came from many different backgrounds. This allowed me to work on projects with all sorts of people,
            and helped me develop proficient interpersonal skills that I still apply today.
