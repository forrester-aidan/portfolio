        <h1>My Digital Portfolio</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Dear Recruiter,</p> 
        <p>Please accept this portfolio as an expression of my interest in the STEP Internship position. With a track record of initiative
            and dependability, I have devised strategic attributes which I believe will prove valuable to Google. Please take a look 
            at my attached resume for a shortened look at my skills and experience. Here's a snapshot of what I have to offer:</p>
        <p>Throughout the course of my career, I have perfected my understanding of coding languages and interpersonal abilities. 
            I am a capable and consistent problem-solver proficient at prioritizing and managing projects. I am 
            progressive-minded and in tune with new developments in my field. I have proven to be effective and collaborative 
            with strong critical thinking talents. I enjoy collective brainstorming sessions which allow me to coordinate activities 
            to achieve a common goal. Please use this portfolio as a means to get to know me better, and weigh the possibilities of me working at your company in the summer.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Aidan Forrester</p>
