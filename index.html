        <p>Throughout the course of my career, I have perfected my understanding of coding languages and interpersonal abilities. 
            I am a capable and consistent problem-solver skilled at prioritizing and managing projects with proficiency.I am 
            progressive-minded and in tune with new developments in my field. I have proven to be effective and collaborative 
            with strong critical thinking talents. I enjoy collective brainstorming sessions which allow me to coordinate activities 
            to achieve a common goal. Please use this portfolio as a means to get to know me better, and weigh the possibilities of me working at your company in the summer.</p>
