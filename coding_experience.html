        <h4>HTML/CSS</h4>
        <h4>Class: AP Computer Science Principles (2019-2020)</h4>
        <h4>Description: </h4>
        <p>I spent half my sophomore year learning all about HTML and CSS, and so far they have been one of my favorite languages to
            work in. It was the first language to guide my hand into the world of coding itself. I remember for almost four to five months 
            of just me staring at coding, trying to make any sense of how it works. And 
            then one day, in mid-January, it all just clicked. I started to write code like a mad man, and immediately fell in love with
            the subject. These two languages may be pretty simplistic when it comes to the languages like C++ and Java, but they were very
            special to me. 
        </p>

        <h4>JavaScript</h4>
        <h4>Class: AP Computer Science Principles (2019-2020)</h4>
        <h4>Description: </h4>
        <p> This language was the first experience I had with backend development, and to be honest, it did not go very well from the start. 
            After just learning the interworkings of HTML and CSS, jumping into the logic of JS was something brain didn't process well
            at first. I took a lot of baby steps with this language, and eventually, by the end of the year, I was able to analyze and
            create new code all on my own. 
        </p>

        <h4>Java</h4>
        <h4>Class: AP Computer Science A (2020-2021)</h4>
        <h4>Description: </h4>
        <p> Surprisingly, I took a liking to the syntax of Java. Due to the similarities it has with Javascript (which I had previously
            just learned) it made it super easy to jump between these two languages. The logic was still the same, I just needed to use
            different wording/syntax. Everything being organized into classes made it way easier to understand too. 
        </p>

        <h4>SQL</h4>
        <h4>Class: Database Development and Programming (2021-2022)</h4>
        <h4>Description: </h4>
        <p>I did get the chance to learn SQL, but I had a tough time learning everything about the language. Halfway through the year,
            we lost our teacher, and couldn't find a replacement for almost 3 months. Unfortunately, that meant a lot of us students
            forgot all about database development (entities, attributes, relationships, etc.), since we never got to actual coding until 
            May. Therefore, I didn't get the best experience with this language, but if it was presented to me I could understand how most
            of the code will operate.  
        </p>

        <h4>Python</h4>
        <h4>Class: Advanced Computing Fundamentals (2022)</h4>
        <h4>Description: </h4>
        <p>This language was by far the easiest to pick up, and I'm sure most people end up saying that. The syntax is super simple,
            and it's efficient to make projects this way. However, it doesn't have as many options as bigger languages like Java and C++
            do, so its uses are limited. My favorite projects were done in this language, and even though sometimes it was tough, I'd 
            always enjoy the time spent on these types of projects. 
        </p>

        <h4>C++</h4>
        <h4>Class: Advanced Computing Fundamentals (2022-Present)</h4>
        <h4>Description: </h4>
        <p>This is by far the hardest language I have ever tried to learn. The worst part is we just finished coding in Python, so the 
            jump between language syntax is too difficult to understand. Sometimes, I see myself typing out conditional statements without
            any parentheses out of habit. But, as of right now, I've become more comfortable with the language, as we dive into the deeper parts
            of it (dynamic memory, linked lists, binary tree, etc.).
